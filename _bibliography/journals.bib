abstract = {Purpose: To develop and evaluate a technique for 3D dynamic MRI of the full vocal tract at high temporal resolution during natural speech. 
Methods: We demonstrate 2.4 × 2.4 × 5.8 mm3 spatial resolution, 61-ms temporal resolution, and a 200 × 200 × 70 mm3 FOV. The proposed method uses 3D gradient-echo imaging with a custom upper-airway coil, a minimum-phase slab excitation, stack-of-spirals readout, pseudo golden-angle view order in kx-ky, linear Cartesian order along kz, and spatiotemporal finite difference constrained reconstruction, with 13-fold acceleration. This technique is evaluated using in vivo vocal tract airway data from 2 healthy subjects acquired at 1.5T scanner, 1 with synchronized audio, with 2 tasks during production of natural speech, and via comparison with interleaved multislice 2D dynamic MRI. 
Results: This technique captured known dynamics of vocal tract articulators during natural speech tasks including tongue gestures during the production of consonants “s” and “l” and of consonant–vowel syllables, and was additionally consistent with 2D dynamic MRI. Coordination of lingual (tongue) movements for consonants is demonstrated via volume-of-interest analysis. Vocal tract area function dynamics revealed critical lingual constriction events along the length of the vocal tract for consonants and vowels. 
Conclusion: We demonstrate feasibility of 3D dynamic MRI of the full vocal tract, with spatiotemporal resolution adequate to visualize lingual movements for consonants and vocal tact shaping during natural productions of consonant–vowel syllables, without requiring multiple repetitions.},

abstract = {Purpose: To improve the depiction and tracking of vocal tract articulators in spiral real-time MRI (RT-MRI) of speech production by estimating and correcting for dynamic changes in off-resonance. 
Methods: The proposed method computes a dynamic field map from the phase of single-TE dynamic images after a coil phase compensation where complex coil sensitivity maps are estimated from the single-TE dynamic scan itself. This method is tested using simulations and in vivo data. The depiction of air–tissue boundaries is evaluated quantitatively using a sharpness metric and visual inspection. 
Results: Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method provides robust off-resonance correction for spiral readout durations up to 5 ms at 1.5T. In -vivo experiments during human speech production demonstrate that image sharpness is improved in a majority of data sets at air–tissue boundaries including the upper lip, hard palate, soft palate, and tongue boundaries, whereas the lower lip shows little improvement in the edge sharpness after correction. 
Conclusion: Dynamic off-resonance correction is feasible from single-TE spiral RT-MRI data, and provides a practical performance improvement in articulator sharpness when applied to speech production imaging.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of through-time spiral generalized autocalibrating partial parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) for low-latency accelerated real-time MRI of speech. 
Methods: Through-time spiral GRAPPA (spiral GRAPPA), a fast linear reconstruction method, is applied to spiral (k-t) data acquired from an eight-channel custom upper-airway coil. Fully sampled data were retrospectively down-sampled to evaluate spiral GRAPPA at undersampling factors R = 2 to 6. Pseudo-golden-angle spiral acquisitions were used for prospective studies. Three subjects were imaged while performing a range of speech tasks that involved rapid articulator movements, including fluent speech and beat-boxing. Spiral GRAPPA was compared with view sharing, and a parallel imaging and compressed sensing (PI-CS) method. 
Results: Spiral GRAPPA captured spatiotemporal dynamics of vocal tract articulators at undersampling factors ≤4. Spiral GRAPPA at 18 ms/frame and 2.4 mm2/pixel outperformed view sharing in depicting rapidly moving articulators. Spiral GRAPPA and PI-CS provided equivalent temporal fidelity. Reconstruction latency per frame was 14 ms for view sharing and 116 ms for spiral GRAPPA, using a single processor. Spiral GRAPPA kept up with the MRI data rate of 18ms/frame with eight processors. PI-CS required 17 minutes to reconstruct 5 seconds of dynamic data. 
Conclusion: Spiral GRAPPA enabled 4-fold accelerated real-time MRI of speech with a low reconstruction latency. This approach is applicable to wide range of speech RT-MRI experiments that benefit from real-time feedback while visualizing rapid articulator movement.

abstract = {Purpose: To obtain three-dimensional (3D) MR angiography having high contrast between vessel and stationary background tissue, a novel technique called sliding time of flight (TOF) is proposed. 
Methods: The proposed method relies on the property that flow-related enhancement (FRE) is maximized at the blood-entering slice in an imaging slab. For the proposed sliding TOF, a sliding stack-of-stars sampling and a dynamic MR image reconstruction algorithm were developed. To verify the performance of the proposed method, in vivo study was performed and the results were compared with multiple overlapping thin 3D slab acquisition (MOTSA) and sliding interleaved ky (SLINKY). 
Results: In MOTSA and SLINKY, the variation of FRE resulted in severe venetian blind (MOTSA) or ghost (SLINKY) artifacts, while the vessel-contrast increased as the flip angle of radiofrequency (RF) pulses increased. On the other hand, the proposed method could provide high-contrast angiograms with reduced FRE-related artifacts. 
Conclusion: The sliding TOF can provide 3D angiography without image artifacts even if high flip angle RF pulses with thick slab excitation are used. Although remains of subsampling artifacts can be present in the reconstructed images, they can be reduced by MIP operation and resolved further by regularization techniques.

abstract = {Purpose:
To mitigate a common artifact in spiral real‐time MRI, caused by aliasing of signal outside the desired FOV. This artifact frequently occurs in midsagittal speech real‐time MRI.

Methods:
Simulations were performed to determine the likely origin of the artifact. Two methods to mitigate the artifact are proposed. The first approach, denoted as “large FOV” (LF), keeps an FOV that is large enough to include the artifact signal source during reconstruction. The second approach, denoted as “estimation‐subtraction” (ES), estimates the artifact signal source before subtracting a synthetic signal representing that source in multicoil k‐space raw data. Twenty‐five midsagittal speech‐production real‐time MRI data sets were used to evaluate both of the proposed methods. Reconstructions without and with corrections were evaluated by two expert readers using a 5‐level Likert scale assessing artifact severity. Reconstruction time was also compared.

Results:
The origin of the artifact was found to be a combination of gradient nonlinearity and imperfect anti‐aliasing in spiral sampling. The LF and ES methods were both able to substantially reduce the artifact, with an averaged qualitative score improvement of 1.25 and 1.35 Likert levels for LF correction and ES correction, respectively. Average reconstruction time without correction, with LF correction, and with ES correction were 160.69 ± 1.56, 526.43 ± 5.17, and 171.47 ± 1.71 ms/frame.

Conclusion:
Both proposed methods were able to reduce the spiral aliasing artifacts, with the ES‐reduction method being more effective and more time efficient.}

abstract = {Purpose: 
To provide 3D real‐time MRI of speech production with improved spatio‐temporal sharpness using randomized, variable‐density, stack‐of‐spiral sampling combined with a 3D spatio‐temporally constrained reconstruction.

Methods:
We evaluated five candidate (k, t) sampling strategies using a previously proposed gradient‐echo stack‐of‐spiral sequence and a 3D constrained reconstruction with spatial and temporal penalties. Regularization parameters were chosen by expert readers based on qualitative assessment. We experimentally determined the effect of spiral angle increment and kz temporal order. The strategy yielding highest image quality was chosen as the proposed method. We evaluated the proposed and original 3D real‐time MRI methods in 2 healthy subjects performing speech production tasks that invoke rapid movements of articulators seen in multiple planes, using interleaved 2D real‐time MRI as the reference. We quantitatively evaluated tongue boundary sharpness in three locations at two speech rates.

Results:
The proposed data‐sampling scheme uses a golden‐angle spiral increment in the kx−ky plane and variable‐density, randomized encoding along kz. It provided a statistically significant improvement in tongue boundary sharpness score (P < .001) in the blade, body, and root of the tongue during normal and 1.5‐times speeded speech. Qualitative improvements were substantial during natural speech tasks of alternating high, low tongue postures during vowels. The proposed method was also able to capture complex tongue shapes during fast alveolar consonant segments. Furthermore, the proposed scheme allows flexible retrospective selection of temporal resolution.

Conclusion:
We have demonstrated improved 3D real‐time MRI of speech production using randomized, variable‐density, stack‐of‐spiral sampling with a 3D spatio‐temporally constrained reconstruction.},

abstract = {Real‐time magnetic resonance imaging (RT‐MRI) allows for imaging dynamic processes as they occur, without relying on any repetition or synchronization. This is made possible by modern MRI technology such as fast‐switching gradients and parallel imaging. It is compatible with many (but not all) MRI sequences, including spoiled gradient echo, balanced steady‐state free precession, and single‐shot rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement. RT‐MRI has earned an important role in both diagnostic imaging and image guidance of invasive procedures. Its unique diagnostic value is prominent in areas of the body that undergo substantial and often irregular motion, such as the heart, gastrointestinal system, upper airway vocal tract, and joints. Its value in interventional procedure guidance is prominent for procedures that require multiple forms of soft‐tissue contrast, as well as flow information. In this review, we discuss the history of RT‐MRI, fundamental tradeoffs, enabling technology, established applications, and current trends.},

abstract = {Purpose To develop and evaluate a fast and effective method for deblurring spiral real-time MRI (RT-MRI) using convolutional neural networks. Methods We demonstrate a 3-layer residual convolutional neural networks to correct image domain off-resonance artifacts in speech production spiral RT-MRI without the knowledge of field maps. The architecture is motivated by the traditional deblurring approaches. Spatially varying off-resonance blur is synthetically generated by using discrete object approximation and field maps with data augmentation from a large database of 2D human speech production RT-MRI. The effect of off-resonance range, shift-invariance of blur, and readout durations on deblurring performance are investigated. The proposed method is validated using synthetic and real data with longer readouts, quantitatively using image quality metrics and qualitatively via visual inspection, and with a comparison to conventional deblurring methods. Results Deblurring performance was found superior to a current autocalibrated method for in vivo data and only slightly worse than an ideal reconstruction with perfect knowledge of the field map for synthetic test data. Convolutional neural networks deblurring made it possible to visualize articulator boundaries with readouts up to 8 ms at 1.5 T, which is 3-fold longer than the current standard practice. The computation time was 12.3 ± 2.2 ms per frame, enabling low-latency processing for RT-MRI applications. Conclusion Convolutional neural networks deblurring is a practical, efficient, and field map-free approach for the deblurring of spiral RT-MRI. In the context of speech production imaging, this can enable 1.7-fold improvement in scan efficiency and the use of spiral readouts at higher field strengths such as 3 T.},

abstract = {Purpose: To develop and evaluate a technique for 3D dynamic MRI of the full vocal tract at high temporal resolution during natural speech. 
Methods: We demonstrate 2.4 × 2.4 × 5.8 mm3 spatial resolution, 61-ms temporal resolution, and a 200 × 200 × 70 mm3 FOV. The proposed method uses 3D gradient-echo imaging with a custom upper-airway coil, a minimum-phase slab excitation, stack-of-spirals readout, pseudo golden-angle view order in kx-ky, linear Cartesian order along kz, and spatiotemporal finite difference constrained reconstruction, with 13-fold acceleration. This technique is evaluated using in vivo vocal tract airway data from 2 healthy subjects acquired at 1.5T scanner, 1 with synchronized audio, with 2 tasks during production of natural speech, and via comparison with interleaved multislice 2D dynamic MRI. 
Results: This technique captured known dynamics of vocal tract articulators during natural speech tasks including tongue gestures during the production of consonants “s” and “l” and of consonant–vowel syllables, and was additionally consistent with 2D dynamic MRI. Coordination of lingual (tongue) movements for consonants is demonstrated via volume-of-interest analysis. Vocal tract area function dynamics revealed critical lingual constriction events along the length of the vocal tract for consonants and vowels. 
Conclusion: We demonstrate feasibility of 3D dynamic MRI of the full vocal tract, with spatiotemporal resolution adequate to visualize lingual movements for consonants and vocal tact shaping during natural productions of consonant–vowel syllables, without requiring multiple repetitions.},

abstract = {Purpose: To improve the depiction and tracking of vocal tract articulators in spiral real-time MRI (RT-MRI) of speech production by estimating and correcting for dynamic changes in off-resonance. 
Methods: The proposed method computes a dynamic field map from the phase of single-TE dynamic images after a coil phase compensation where complex coil sensitivity maps are estimated from the single-TE dynamic scan itself. This method is tested using simulations and in vivo data. The depiction of air–tissue boundaries is evaluated quantitatively using a sharpness metric and visual inspection. 
Results: Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method provides robust off-resonance correction for spiral readout durations up to 5 ms at 1.5T. In -vivo experiments during human speech production demonstrate that image sharpness is improved in a majority of data sets at air–tissue boundaries including the upper lip, hard palate, soft palate, and tongue boundaries, whereas the lower lip shows little improvement in the edge sharpness after correction. 
Conclusion: Dynamic off-resonance correction is feasible from single-TE spiral RT-MRI data, and provides a practical performance improvement in articulator sharpness when applied to speech production imaging.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of through-time spiral generalized autocalibrating partial parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) for low-latency accelerated real-time MRI of speech. 
Methods: Through-time spiral GRAPPA (spiral GRAPPA), a fast linear reconstruction method, is applied to spiral (k-t) data acquired from an eight-channel custom upper-airway coil. Fully sampled data were retrospectively down-sampled to evaluate spiral GRAPPA at undersampling factors R = 2 to 6. Pseudo-golden-angle spiral acquisitions were used for prospective studies. Three subjects were imaged while performing a range of speech tasks that involved rapid articulator movements, including fluent speech and beat-boxing. Spiral GRAPPA was compared with view sharing, and a parallel imaging and compressed sensing (PI-CS) method. 
Results: Spiral GRAPPA captured spatiotemporal dynamics of vocal tract articulators at undersampling factors ≤4. Spiral GRAPPA at 18 ms/frame and 2.4 mm2/pixel outperformed view sharing in depicting rapidly moving articulators. Spiral GRAPPA and PI-CS provided equivalent temporal fidelity. Reconstruction latency per frame was 14 ms for view sharing and 116 ms for spiral GRAPPA, using a single processor. Spiral GRAPPA kept up with the MRI data rate of 18ms/frame with eight processors. PI-CS required 17 minutes to reconstruct 5 seconds of dynamic data. 
Conclusion: Spiral GRAPPA enabled 4-fold accelerated real-time MRI of speech with a low reconstruction latency. This approach is applicable to wide range of speech RT-MRI experiments that benefit from real-time feedback while visualizing rapid articulator movement.

abstract = {Purpose: To obtain three-dimensional (3D) MR angiography having high contrast between vessel and stationary background tissue, a novel technique called sliding time of flight (TOF) is proposed. 
Methods: The proposed method relies on the property that flow-related enhancement (FRE) is maximized at the blood-entering slice in an imaging slab. For the proposed sliding TOF, a sliding stack-of-stars sampling and a dynamic MR image reconstruction algorithm were developed. To verify the performance of the proposed method, in vivo study was performed and the results were compared with multiple overlapping thin 3D slab acquisition (MOTSA) and sliding interleaved ky (SLINKY). 
Results: In MOTSA and SLINKY, the variation of FRE resulted in severe venetian blind (MOTSA) or ghost (SLINKY) artifacts, while the vessel-contrast increased as the flip angle of radiofrequency (RF) pulses increased. On the other hand, the proposed method could provide high-contrast angiograms with reduced FRE-related artifacts. 
Conclusion: The sliding TOF can provide 3D angiography without image artifacts even if high flip angle RF pulses with thick slab excitation are used. Although remains of subsampling artifacts can be present in the reconstructed images, they can be reduced by MIP operation and resolved further by regularization techniques.

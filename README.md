A simple and clean [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics.

[![Screenshot](assets/img/full-screenshot.png)](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/)

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
The emphasis is on whitespace, transparency, and academic usage: [theme demo](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/).

## Getting started

**I follow the instructions shown on [the orginal site](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) and add here some more steps to follow.**

### Installation

1. Install Command Line Tools<br/>
    Open Terminal. Check to see if you have XCode Command Line Tools installed by typing gcc -v. At this point, it will prompt you to install if you don't. Or run this code to install:
    ```bash
	$ xcode-select --install
	```

2. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)<br/> 
	Ruby should come pre-installed on all OSX computers. You can check if Ruby is installed by running ruby -v. It should return with Ruby version 2.0.0 or higher. ruby 2.0.0p645 (2015-04-13 revision 50299) [universal.x86_64-darwin15].
	If for some reason you're running a lower version, you can update.
	```bash
	$ sudo gem install ruby
    ```

3. Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)<br/>
	Bundler is a package manager that will aid you in installing all the Jekyll dependencies.
	```bash
	$ sudo gem install bundler jekyll
	```

4. Fork the theme<br/>
	Fork from `github.com:alshedivat/al-folio` to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` (get an instruction [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) and do the following:
	```bash
	$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
	$ cd <your-repo-name>
	$ bundle install
	$ bundle exec jekyll serve
	```

	For example, you can type:
	```bash
	$ git clone git@github.com:yongwanlim/yongwanlim.github.io.git
	$ cd yongwanlim.github.io
	$ bundle install
	$ bundle exec jekyll serve
	```

5. Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!). After you are done, **commit** your final changes.<br/>
	```bash
	$ git remote -v
	$ git status
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m “initial commit”
	```

6. Modify your `_config.yml`<br/>
	**Note:** when deploying your user or organization page, make sure the `_config.yml` has `url` and `baseurl` fields as follows.

	```
	url: # should be empty
	baseurl:  # should be empty
	```

7. Deploy your website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) by running the deploy script:

	```bash
	$ ./bin/deploy --user
	```

	_al-folio_ said: 

	> By default, the script uses the `master` branch for the source code and deploys the webpage to `gh-pages`.
	The optional flag `--user` tells it to deploy to `master` and use `source` for the source code instead.
	Using `master` for deployment is a convention for [user and organization pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).

8. Now, you are all set. Visit `https://<your-username>/<your-repo-name>`. For example, here my webpage address is https://yongwanlim.github.io/.

###**Real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RT-MRI)**
My Ph.D. research has mainly focused on the development of novel MRI acquisition, reconstruction, and processing methods that overcome fundamental imaging trade-offs and enable rapid real-time MRI with high-quality full spatial coverage with minimum latency.

####**3D real-time imaging**
_How can we better understand speech production using RT-MRI techniques?_  

Current RT-MRI techniques can provide high temporal and spatial resolution dynamic images, but most of which are limited to visualizing one or a few 2D imaging planes (2D RT-MRI). This is mainly due to the intrinsic MRI tradeoffs among imaging parameters: increasing one requires to sacrifice another, for example, temporal resolution versus spatial coverage. However, body parts consisting of muscles and joints involved in significant motions are enormously complex in 3D geometry and in temporal structuring and cannot be fully understood from limited 2D imaging planes.


In this project, we develop and evaluate a technique for 3D RT-MRI that enables visualization of the entire vocal organs at high temporal and spatial resolution during natural speech production.

####**Image deblurring**
_How can we achieve better image quality for RT-MRI?_

In the context of _spiral_ RT-MRI, vocal organs' boundaries suffer from spatially and temporally varying blurring due to _off-resonance effect_. It is necessary to improve depiction and tracking of vocal articulators for RT-MRI. 


In this project, we develop deblurring methods that deal with the spatial varying blur.

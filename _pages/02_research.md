#### **3D real-time MRI imaging**
How can we better understand speech production?  
Real-time MRI (RT-MRI) techniques have been generally limited to a few 2D imaging planes because of intrinsic tradeoffs in MRI. However, _vocal tract shaping during speech_ is
enormously complex in geometry and in temporal structuring and cannot be fully understood from limited 2D imaging planes captured along the vocal tract. In this project, I develop and evaluate a technique for 3D RT-MRI that enables visualization of the full vocal tract at high temporal resolution during natural speech.

#### **Image deblurring for spiral MRI**
How can we achieve a better image quality of RT-MRI? How can we improve the depiction and tracking of vocal tract articulators in RT-MRI?  
Vocal organs' boundaries suffer from spatially and temporally varying blurring due to _off-resonance effect_ inevitable in MRI. In this project, I develop a deblurring method for dealing with the spatial varying blur.

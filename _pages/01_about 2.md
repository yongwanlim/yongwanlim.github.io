I am an electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student in the [Magnetic Resonance Engineerining Lab (MREL)](https://mrel.usc.edu/) and [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab (SAIL)](https://sail.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/). I am co-advised by [Dr. Krishna S. Nayak](http://sipi.usc.edu/~knayak/) and [Dr. Shrikanth Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.html).

My research interests are broadly in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), signal and image processing, machine learning, and deep learning. Specifically, my current research focuses on improving real-time MRI technique for speech production research, and includes image deblurring and low-latency image reconstruction using machine learning approaches.

Prior to USC, I worked at [KIST MRL](https://mrlab.imrc.kist.re.kr/) as a Researcher. I earned Master and Bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering from the [Korea Advanced Institution of Science and Technology (KAIST)](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/index.html) in 2014, and the [Sogang University](http://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr) in 2012, respectively.

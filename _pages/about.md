I am an electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student in the Magnetic Resonance Engineerining Lab (MREL) and Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab (SAIL) at the University of Southern California. I am co-advised by Dr. Krishna S. Nayak and Dr. Shrikanth Narayanan.

My research interests are broadly in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), signal and image processing, machine learning, and deep learning. Specifically, my current research focuses on improving real-time MRI technique for speech production research, and includes image deblurring and low-latency image reconstruction using machine learning approaches.

Prior to USC, I worked at KIST as a Researcher. I earned Master and Bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Korea Advanced Institution of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2014, and the Sogang University in 2012, repectively.

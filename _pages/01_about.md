I am a research scientist in Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Viterbi School of Engineering at the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/) where I also serve as MR Physicst at [Dynamic Imaging Science Center](https://disc.usc.edu). 

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from USC in December 2020. Since starting my Ph.D. study, I have worked closely with [Dr. Krishna S. Nayak](http://sipi.usc.edu/~knayak/) (co-advisor),  [Dr. Shrikanth Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.html) (co-advisor), and [Dr. Dani Byrd](https://sites.google.com/view/danibyrd-home) in the [Magnetic Resonance Engineerining Lab (MREL)](https://mrel.usc.edu/), [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab (SAIL)](https://sail.usc.edu/), and [Speech Production and Articulation kNowledge (SPAN)](https://span.usc.edu/) group at USC. 

My research interests are broadly in the development of novel computational imaging and post-processing techniques based on signal processing, mathematical optimization, and machine and deep learning. A majority of my current research effort is dedicated to optimizing and developing new MRI methods for USC's 0.55T MRI. My past research experience was focused on pulse sequence design, data sampling and reconstruction, and artifact mitigation for real-time magnetic resonance imaging for human speech production.

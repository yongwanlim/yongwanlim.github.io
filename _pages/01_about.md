I am a research scientist in Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Viterbi School of Engineering at the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/) where I also serve as MR Physicst at [Dynamic Imaging Science Center](https://disc.usc.edu). 

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from USC in December 2020. Since starting my Ph.D. study, I have worked closely with [Dr. Krishna S. Nayak](http://sipi.usc.edu/~knayak/) (co-advisor),  [Dr. Shrikanth Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.html) (co-advisor), and [Dr. Dani Byrd](https://sites.google.com/view/danibyrd-home) in the [Magnetic Resonance Engineerining Lab (MREL)](https://mrel.usc.edu/), [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab (SAIL)](https://sail.usc.edu/), and [Speech Production and Articulation kNowledge (SPAN)](https://span.usc.edu/) group at USC. 

My research interests are broadly in developing novel computational imaging and post-processing techniques based on signal processing, mathematical optimization, and machine and deep learning.
